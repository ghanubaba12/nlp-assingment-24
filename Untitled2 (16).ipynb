    "Q3. How are activation functions used during forward propagation?\n",
    "asn-Activation functions are an integral part of forward propagation in a neural network. They introduce non-linearities and allow the network to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs. Activation functions are applied to the output of each neuron in a layer during forward propagation to introduce non-linear transformations to the input data.\n",

    "Each neuron in a layer computes the weighted sum of its inputs, including the bias term. This is the linear transformation step.\n",

    "Sigmoid: It squashes the output between 0 and 1, which is useful for binary classification problems.\n",
    "ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit): It returns the input as is if it's positive, and zero otherwise. ReLU is widely used in deep learning due to its simplicity and ability to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem.\n",

    "Q4. What is the role of weights and biases in forward propagation?\n",
    "ans-In forward propagation, the weights and biases play essential roles in computing the activations and outputs of a neural network. Here's an explanation of their roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "Weights:\n",
    "\n",
    "Weights are parameters associated with the connections between neurons in a neural network.\n",
    "Each connection between neurons is assigned a weight, which determines the strength or importance of that connection.\n",
    "During forward propagation, the weighted sum of inputs is computed by multiplying each input by its corresponding weight and summing them up.\n",
    "The weights control the contribution of each input to the activations and outputs of subsequent layers.\n",
    "Adjusting the weights during the training process allows the neural network to learn and adapt its behavior based on the input data.\n",
    "Biases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Biases are additional parameters associated with each neuron in a neural network.\n",
    "A bias term is independent of the input data and helps shift the activation function's output.\n",

    "Biases allow the neural network to introduce an additional degree of freedom and control the output even when all inputs are zero.\n",
    "Similar to weights, biases are adjusted during training to optimize the network's performance and improve its ability to represent complex functions.\n",
    "In summary, weights determine the importance and contribution of inputs to the network's activations, while biases allow the network to shift the activation function's output. By adjusting the weights and biases during the training process, the neural network can learn to make appropriate decisions or predictions based on the input data.\n",

    "Q5. What is the purpose of applying a softmax function in the output layer during forward propagation?\n",
    "asn-The purpose of applying a softmax function in the output layer during forward propagation is to convert the output of a neural network into a probability distribution over multiple classes. It is commonly used in multi-class classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why the softmax function is used in the output layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability Interpretation: The softmax function takes the outputs from the previous layer and normalizes them to produce a probability distribution. Each output value represents the estimated probability of the corresponding class. By applying softmax, we can interpret the network's outputs as probabilities, where higher values indicate a higher likelihood of belonging to a particular class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutual Exclusivity: Softmax ensures that the probabilities of all classes sum up to 1. This is important when dealing with mutually exclusive classes, where an input can only belong to one class. The softmax function enforces this constraint, making it suitable for multi-class classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiation and Training: Softmax is differentiable, which is essential for training the neural network using gradient-based optimization algorithms such as backpropagation. By computing the derivative of the softmax function, the network's weights can be updated through the backpropagation algorithm, allowing the model to learn from the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying the softmax function, the neural network's output layer produces a probability distribution that indicates the likelihood of each class. This distribution can then be used to make predictions by selecting the class with the highest probability or to analyze the model's confidence in its predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that the softmax function is typically used in the output layer for multi-class classification problems. For binary classification problems, the sigmoid activation function is often used in the output layer to produce a single probability value between 0 and 1.\n",
